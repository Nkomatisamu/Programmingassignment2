The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

set the value of the vector
get the value of the vector
set the value of the mean
get the value of the mean
makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmean = setmean,
       getmean = getmean)
}
he following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.
cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getmean()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- mean(data, ...)
  x$setmean(m)
  m
}
